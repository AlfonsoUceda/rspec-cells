h2. 0.1.0
 
h3. Changes
  * Removed @ViewAssigns@. Maintenance Release.

h2. 0.0.5
 
h3. Changes
  * Works with RSpec-2.6 now, too.
  * We no longer provide our own Capybara string matchers but delegate to @Capybara.string@. If you ever used the @==@ equality check, this won't work anymore. As a tradeoff, you get all string matchers Capybara comes up with, making rspec-cells forward-compatible.


h2. 0.0.4
 
h3. Changes
  * Use Capybara's string matchers in your specs now (if you like)!


h2. 0.0.2
 
h3. Bugfixes
  * Using a Railtie to correctly load rspec-cells. Caused a dependency problem with capybara before. Thanks to Steve Sloan [CodeMonkeySteve] for fixing and Brandon Dimcheff [bdimcheff] for debugging.
